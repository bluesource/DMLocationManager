# DMLocationManager: iOS CLLocationManager made easy

Differences from the original repo: iOS 8 support, some bug fixes (c) progn
Autor of original DMLocationManager: Daniele Margutti

DMLocationManager made iOS's Location Manager easy to use. It supports blocks, reverse geocoding (from coordinates to address) and viceversa (from address string to it's GPS coordinates).
It's all block based and uses NSOperationQueue to optimize multiple requests.

It requires iOS >= 5.

## How to use it

DMLocationManager is a singleton class, so just call one of the available methods from [DMLocationManager shared] instance.

How to obtain current user's location:
``` objective-c
    [[DMLocationManager shared] obtainCurrentLocationAndReverse:NO
                                                   withAccuracy:kCLLocationAccuracyHundredMeters
                                                       useCache:NO
                                                   completition:^(CLLocation *location, CLPlacemark *placemark, NSError *error) {
                                             }];
```

How to obtain address's CLPlacemark object from CLLocation:
    
``` objective-c
[[DMLocationManager shared] obtainAddressFromLocation:[[CLLocation alloc] initWithLatitude:41.90789 longitude:12.537514]
                                             completition:^(CLPlacemark *placemark, NSString *address,NSString *locality,NSError* error) {
                                             }];
```

How to obtain GPS coordinates from address NSString:

``` objective-c
[[DMLocationManager shared] obtainCoordinatesFromAddress:@"Via Vassallo 23, Roma"
                                                completition:^(CLLocation *location, NSError *error) {
                                                }];
```
